# Basilica Sudak
This is my most recent and mostly advanced interactive three-dimensional reconstruction. With app you can explore this model with controlled fps camera. You can examine this model from outside and inside. It has full support of Windows, Linux and Android. Thanks to UE4, it has attractive picture while having multiplatform support.

The model is created on many photos and precise measurements of this building remains. The most of modelling part is made by Yellika – an amazing 3d artist. While I made it into interactive app.
